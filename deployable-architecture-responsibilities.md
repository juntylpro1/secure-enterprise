Terraform Providers version requirements are documented within the `version.tf` file for each deployable architecture. |
| Third-party Terraform Providers used within templates | N/A  | Customer is responsible for any use of third-party Terraform code that is used with the deployable architecture.  |
| Running default configuration (out of the box)| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to create and deploy configurations of deployable architectures by using projects, Terraform-as-a-service, or the projects CLI.  | Use projects to [configure and deploy a deployable architecture](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-project).  |
| Running templates locally by using Terraform directly | N/A  | Customer can run the deployable architecture on their local system.  |
| Customize modules or deployable architectures with pre-supported modules | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides and supports base Terraform modules for services on IBM Cloud, and provides preset JSON configuration overrides for templates. | Customer can use these base Terraform modules to extend their base deployable architecture pattern.  |
| Workload Management (Application Migration and Backup/Restore) | N/A | Customer responsibility to manage and migrate application workloads. |
| Fixes, new features, and updates to the next major deployable architecture release  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides regular updates, bug fixes, and new features in a continuous delivery model that is apparent to the customer. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides a migration path when possible. | N/A |
| Keep deployed services and resources up to date | N/A | Apply fixes and updates to the compute resources that are created from the deployable architecture. These resources are not updated through the deployable architecture unless otherwise indicated. |
| Issues found in IBM-provided versions of Terraform modules | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides a way for customers to open issues. If the issue is with a deployable architecture, open a case. If the issue is with a module, open an issue in the module [GitHub repo](https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules){: external}. | Customer provides information to reproduce any problem. |
| Issues with IBM container images | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides a way for customers to open issues. | Customer provides information to reproduce any problem. |
| Issues with third party and open source container images | N/A | Customer resolves with third-party vendor or open source community. |

| Issues with the services that the Terraform creates from a deployable architecture | {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resolves issues with the services. | N/A |
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} resource outages or issues that occur during automated template execution by using {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terraform Provider | IBM reports outages for any cloud resources on the [Status](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external} page. | Customers can redeploy after the issue is resolved.|
| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog and private catalog support | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides a way for you to discover available deployable architectures in our public catalog and save your versions to a private catalog. | N/A |
| Provide ability for drift detection | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} notifies you if your instantiated resources differ from the base pattern. | Customer decides when to remediate any configurations detected in drift detection. |
| Pulling deployable architecture changes into a project| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to update the version of a deployable architecture in a project if a new version becomes available. | Customers are [notified when a new deployable architecture version is available](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-needs-attention-projects#na-version-update) so they can update their project. \n\n Customers can save their existing project data through an API, CLI, or by [exporting the project.json](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-setup-project#json-export) from the UI. The saved information can be used as a backup or as a rollover plan if an issue exists.  \n\n Customers can then test the deployable architecture changes by deploying in a development or test environment before they deploy to production. These actions can all be completed within the same project.  |
| Provide notice of end of support | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides notice through regular channels. | N/A |
