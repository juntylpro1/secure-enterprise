# Why can't I access a project?
{: #troubleshoot-project-access}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

You try to find a project that you created or a project that you thought you had access to from the Projects page in the console, but it isn't listed.
{: shortdesc}

A project that you expected to find in the console from the **Menu** ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg "Menu") > **Projects** page isn't included in your list of projects.
{: tsSymptoms}

Your project might have been deleted by another member of your team, or you don't have the required level of access to view projects.
{: tsCauses}

Make sure that you have the correct access to view projects. For more information, see [Assigning users access to projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-access-project). If your project was deleted, create a new one. If you have the {{site.data.keyword.at_full}} service set up for your account, you can use that to [audit events for a project](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-at_events), including project deletions.
