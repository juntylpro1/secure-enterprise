# Understanding your responsibilities when using projects
{: #responsibilities-projects}

Learn about the management responsibilities and terms and conditions that you have when you use projects. For a high-level view of the service types in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} and the breakdown of responsibilities between the customer and {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} for each type, see [Shared responsibilities for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} offerings](/docs/overview?topic=overview-shared-responsibilities).
{: shortdesc}

Review the following sections for the specific responsibilities for you and for {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} when you use projects. For the overall terms of use, see [{{site.data.keyword.cloud}} Terms and Notices](/docs/overview/terms-of-use?topic=overview-terms).

## Incident and operations management
{: #incident-and-ops-projects}

Incident and operations management includes tasks such as monitoring, event management, high availability, problem determination, recovery, and full state backup and recovery.

| Task | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |
|----------|-----------------------|--------|
|Monitor the status of a project| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to monitor their project's lifecycle.  | Use the [needs attention widget](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-needs-attention-projects) to monitor events that specifically impact the lifecycle of your project. You can also use the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service to [audit events for a project](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-at_events). |

## Change management
{: #change-management-projects}

Change management includes tasks such as deployment, configuration, upgrades, patching, configuration changes, and deletion.

|Task  | {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Responsibilities | Your Responsibilities |

|Updates, fixes, and new features| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides regular updates and bug fixes, as well as new features following a continuous delivery model in a manner transparent to the customer.  | N/A |
|Creating and deploying configurations| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to create and deploy configurations by using projects.  | Use projects to [configure and deploy a deployable architecture](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-config-project).  |
|Deleting a project| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to delete a project.  | Customers can [delete a project](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-delete-project) whenever they need to. |
|Pulling deployable architecture changes into a project| {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} provides the ability for customers to update the version of a deployable architecture in a project, should a new version become available. | Customers are [notified when a new deployable architecture version is available](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-needs-attention-projects#na-version-update) so they can update their project accordingly. \n \n Customers can save their existing project data with API, CLI, or by [exporting the project.json](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-setup-project#json-export) from the UI, which can be used as backup or as rollover plan if there is an issue.  \n \n Customers can then test the deployable architecture changes by deploying in a development or test environment before going to production.  This can all be done within the same project.  |
