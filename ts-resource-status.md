# Why are my resources tainted?
{: #troubleshoot-project-resource}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

When you view your resource list, there are resources with a tainted status.
{: shortdesc}

A resource that you deployed is marked as tainted.
{: tsSymptoms}

Terraform marks a resource that isn't fully functional as tainted. This might be due to a provisioning error, or because Terraform is unable to determine if the resources were successfully or partially created.
{: tsCauses}

Terraform will delete and re-create the resource at the start of the next deployment. You can manually remove the taint status by deleting the resource and re-creating it.
