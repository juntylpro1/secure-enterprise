# Locally editing the catalog manifest
{: #manifest-values}

The catalog manifest file specifies the information about your onboarded solution that you want to share with users through a catalog. You can provide licensing and compliance information, make specific settings, and provide descriptions about the intended purpose of your product.
{: shortdesc}

Prefer to use the console to edit your catalog details? You can make the selections by following the [provided wizard and then export the manifest file](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-onboard-da) to add to your source repo.
{: tip}

## Editing your manifest
{: #edit-manifest}

To edit your manifest locally, you can use the following steps.

1. Copy the following example manifest file into a local editor.
2. Name the file `ibm_catalog.json`.
3. Add your preferred configurations into the file by using the example manifest as a guide. To learn more about each value, view the [available values](#available-values).
4. Add the file into the root folder of your source code repository.
5. [Add your deployable architecture to your catalog](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-onboard-da).

## Example manifest file
{: #example-manifest}

The following code snippet can be used as a template.

## Available values
{: #available-values}

The following sections include information about each value that can be referenced in your manifest file.

### Products
{: #value-products}

The products value indicates an array of products with size one or more. If a catalog manifest file exists at the root of your repository, only the products within the file can be imported. Products are imported one at a time. The following values can be included at the `products` level:

`label`
:   The product display name. This value must match the display name that you provide during onboarding.

`name`
:   The programmatic name of the product.

`version`
:   The version of the product in SemVer format, including the major version, minor version, and revision, for example, 1.0.0. This value can also be specified when the product is onboarded to a catalog.

`product_kind`
:   The kind of product that you are onboarding. Valid values are software, module, or solution. A solution is otherwise known as a deployable architecture.

`tags`
:   An array of predefined values that can help users to filter the catalog to identify and learn more about your product. To view the available options, run the following command: `ibmcloud catalog filter options --all`.

`keywords`
:   An array of specific words or phrases that a user might try to search for.

`short_description`
:   A concise summary of what your product is and its value.

`long_description`
:   A detailed description of your product that explains the product's value and benefits to users.

`provider_name`
:   Users can filter the catalog by the provider of a product. When you onboard a product to a private catalog, the provider name is set to `Community` by default. However, you can customize this field to display your company or organization name. IBM is a reserved value and can be used for IBM build products only.

`offering_docs_url`
:   A link to documentation about the product that users can access.

`offering_icon_url`
:   A link to the URL where icon that you want to appear on the product's catalog entry page is located.

`support_details`
:   Support information in markdown format that can include support contacts, support locations, and support methods.

`features`
:   Section header for details that highlight the processes, abilities, and results of the product. These product-level features are listed on your catalog entry page with your product description. For example, features might incluce CPU requirements, security features, or more. Each entry is defined as an array as shown in the example manifest in the previous section.

    `title`
    :   The name of the feature.

    `description`
    :   A concise description of the feature.



### Modules
{: #value-module}

The `module_info` value indicates information about other products that the deployable architecture is compatible with. The following values can be included at the `module_info` level:

`works_with`
:   Section header for information about a singular product that is compatible with the deployable architecture.

    `catalog_id` (optional)
    :   ID of the catalog that houses the product. If not specified, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog is the default.

    `id` (optional)
    :   ID of the product. The ID is not required if the `name` value is set.

    `name` (optional)
    :   Programmatic name of the product that works with the deployable architecture.

    `kind`
    :   The format of the module that works with your deployable architecture. Most often this is `terraform`.

    `version`
    :   Version or range of product versions that work with the deployable architecture in SemVer format.

    `flavors` (optional)
    :   The programmatic names of the compatible variations. Variations are onboarded individually to a catalog and are given a version number. An example variation name might be `standard` or `advanced`.

`label`
:   Variation display name.

`name`
:   Variation programmatic name.

`working_directory`
:   For a working directory that is at the root level of your repo, you don't need to specify the working directory. If it is not at the root, then list the path from the root of your repository. For example, `./examples/`.

`usage`
:   Information on how to embed the architecture or run it locally through Terraform.

`usage_template`
:   Similar to `usage`. With a template you can use variables as a place holder where the values can be substituted. The string is stored in the `usage` property.

    	"name": "string, license display name",
    	"type": "string, type of license, e.g. Apache xxx",
    	"url": "string, URL for the license text",
    	"description": "string, license description"
    }
    ```
    {: screen}

    `url`
    :   A URL to where the user can access the license agreement.

    `description`
    :   A description of the license.


`compliance`
:   Section header that indicates which compliance controls that the architecture satisfies with the default installation settings. The evaluation and validation of the claims made is completed by {{site.data.keyword.compliance_full}}.

    ```json
    "compliance": {
       "authority": "scc-v3",
       "profiles": [
          {
                "profile_name": "",
                "profile_version": ""
          }
       ]
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    You can list multiple profiles in your catalog manifest JSON file, but note that only the first profile is added to your compliance information in a private catalog.
    {: important}

    `authority`
    :   IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center v3 is the only authority accepted. This is programatically written as `scc-v3`.

    `profiles`
    :   Section header that indicates the profile that contains the controls that are being claimed. You can view predefined profiles in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

        `profile_name`
        :   The name of the profile. For example, `NIST`. You can find the profile name in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

        `profile_version`
        :   The version of the profile. For example, `1.0.0`. You can find the profile name in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

    `controls`
    :   Section header that indicates that the variation has claimed controls. The catalog manifest accepts an array of controls that you can claim on your variation by specifying a control's `profile_name`, `profile_version`, and `control_name`. You can view predefined profiles in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

        `profile`
        :    Section header that indicates that you are adding controls from a specific profile.

            `name`
            :   The profile name of the claimed control. For example, `NIST`. You can find the profile name in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

            `version`
            :   The version of the profile. For example, `1.0.0`. You can find the profile name in {{site.data.keyword.compliance_short}}.

        `names`
        :   Section header to indicate a list of claimed controls. For example:

        ```text
        "names": [
           "CM-7(b)",
           "AC-2(a)"
        ]
        ```
        {: codeblock}

    If you have included controls in your readme and your catalog manifest file, the manifest file takes precedence. It is best practice to make sure the controls listed in your catalog manifest file match the controls in your readme file.
    {: note}


`change_notices` (optional)
:   A list of the three types of changes that you might want to alert your users to when releasing a new version of your deployable architecture. You can specify `breaking changes`, `new features`, and `general updates`. Breaking changes are those updates that break functionality that was available through a previous version. New features highlight any new functionality that a user might encounter with the new version. Updates encompass any changes that you want to highlight to a user such as a modified behavior that doesn't neccessarily break existing functionality or changes that make the deployable architecture easier for them to use.

    ```json
    "change_notices": {
       "breaking": [
          {
             "title": "",
             "description": ""
          }
       ],
       "new_features": [
          {
             "title": "",
             "description": ""

       ],
       "updates": [
          {
             "title": "",
             "description": ""
          }
      ]
    }
    ```
    {: codeblock}


`iam_permissions`(optional)
:   Section header for a list of all IAM permissions that are required for a user to work with your deployable architecture version. IAM permission information includes the programmatic name of the service that is required and a list of CRNs for roles that are needed. If you build your catalog manifest file from the UI, the CRNs are already included.


    ```
    {
       "service_name": "IAM defined service name",
       "role_crns" [
          ""
       ],
       "resources": [
          {
             "name": "",
             "description": "",
             "role_crns: [
                ""
             ]
          }
       ]
    }
    ```

       "descriptions": "",
       "features": [
          {
             "title": "",
             "description": ""
          }
       ],
       "diagrams": [
