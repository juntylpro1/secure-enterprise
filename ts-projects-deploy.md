# Why can't I deploy my changes to a configuration?
{: #troubleshoot-deploy-changes}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

If you're unable to deploy changes to a configuration, you might need an Editor to approve your changes.
{: shortdesc}

You can edit and save changes to a configuration, but you can't deploy them.
{: tsSymptoms}

After you save changes to a configuration, they must be validated. Then, a user who is assigned to the Editor role for projects must approve the changes before they can be deployed.
{: tsCauses}

Contact an Editor on your team to approve the changes to the configuration. Contact your account administrator if you need Editor access to the project service. For more information, see [Assigning users access to projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-access-project).
