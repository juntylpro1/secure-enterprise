# Understanding business continuity and disaster recovery for projects
{: #bc-dr}

Disaster recovery involves a set of policies, tools, and procedures for returning a system, an application, or an entire data center to full operation after a catastrophic interruption. It includes procedures for copying and storing an installed system's essential data in a secure location, and for recovering that data to restore normalcy of operation.

## Responsibilities
{: #bc-dr-responsibilities}

For more information about your responsibilities when using projects, see [Shared responsibilities for projects](/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-responsibilities-projects).

### Disaster recovery strategy
{: #bc-dr-strategy}

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} has business continuity plans in place to provide for the recovery of services within hours if a disaster occurs. You are responsible for your data backup and associated recovery of your content.

{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} performs regular electronic backups of project data with Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of hours as documented in the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Disaster Recovery Plan](/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#disaster-recovery). Projects don't replicate data outside of a region, except for backup data. When possible, backup data is kept within the data centers of a country but data is always kept within a geography. European data does not leave the EU.

| Disaster recovery objective | Target Value   |
|---|---|
|  RPO | 1 hour  |
|  RTO | 4 hours   |
